# Memory-alocator-in-C
Implemented a memory allocator that manages dynamic memory using custom structures. Features include MALLOC, FREE, READ, WRITE, and DUMP_MEMORY, with error handling for segmentation faults and memory fragmentation.
The memory allocator uses a fictive memory allocation model where addresses were stored in a data structure.
